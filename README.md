# InterSCity - Smart City Software Platform

The [InterSCity platform](http://interscity.org/software/interscity-platform/) 
is an open source project to technically support
the development of Smart Cities projects. 
It was created by the Smart City Research Group from the Institute of 
Mathematics and Statistics - University of SÃ£o Paulo in the
context of [the INCT InterSCity](http://interscity.org/).

The main purpose of InterSCity platform is to provide high-level services and APIs 
to support the development of novel services for cities by gathering 
key-enabling technologies such as IoT, Big Data and
Cloud Computer. The platform adopts a microservice architecture which is 
designed to properly support the integration of a large amount of device
and data, and provide quality city-scale services. 

Among others, the platform provides the following features:

* City's resource discovery
* Hide technical details of communication with physical devices
* Provide real-time data from city sensors
* Provide historical data from city sensors
* Data filtering through different parameters
* Intermediate communication with actuators

# Getting Started

If you want to run the InterSCity platform in development environment,
use the [dev-env repository](https://gitlab.com/smart-city-software-platform/dev-env)

# Full Documentation

You can find the detailed project documentation in these links:

# Contibuting

There are several ways to contribute to this project as listed below:

* Developing new features and/or solving microservices' open issues. For this
purpose, you should try to run the platform in your local environment using
the [Dev-env](https://gitlab.com/smart-city-software-platform/dev-env) repository.
* Developing new features to the InterSCity platform ecosystem such as creating
new services, libraries, or frameworks.
* Developing new applications on the top of the InterSCity platform.
* Conducting research in [related areas](research/opportunities.md).
* Improving documentation or producing materials for teaching how to use the platform.
