# Smart City Software Platform

This project is an open source software platform to technically support Smart
Cities projects by gathering key-enabling technologies - IoT, Big Data and
Cloud Computer. 
It was created by the Smart City Research Group from the Institute of 
Mathematics and Statistics - University of SÃ£o Paulo.
The main purpose of this project is to provide high-level services and APIs 
to support the development of novel services for cities. Among other, the 
platform has the following features:

* City's resource discovery
* Hide technical details of communication with physical devices
* Provide real-time data from city sensors
* Provide historical data from city sensors
* Data filtering through different parameters
* Intermediate communication with actuators


The platform adopts a microservice architecture which is designed to 
support the integration of a large amount of device and data, and provide
quality city-scale services.
