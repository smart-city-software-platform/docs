# InterSCity - Smart City Software Platform

The InterSCity platform is an open source project to technically support
the development of Smart Cities projects. 
It was created by the Smart City Research Group from the Institute of 
Mathematics and Statistics - University of SÃ£o Paulo in the
context of [the INCT InterSCity](http://interscity.org/).

The main purpose of InterSCity platform is to provide high-level services and APIs 
to support the development of novel services for cities by gathering 
key-enabling technologies such as IoT, Big Data and
Cloud Computer. The platform adopts a microservice architecture which is 
designed to properly support the integration of a large amount of device
and data, and provide quality city-scale services. 

Among others, the platform provides the following features:

* City's resource discovery
* Hide technical details of communication with physical devices
* Provide real-time data from city sensors
* Provide historical data from city sensors
* Data filtering through different parameters
* Intermediate communication with actuators

# Getting Started

If you want to run the InterSCity platform in development environment,
use the [dev-env repository](https://gitlab.com/smart-city-software-platform/dev-env)
