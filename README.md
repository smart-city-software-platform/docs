# Smart City Software Platform

This project is an open source software platform to technically support Smart
Cities projects development. 
It was created by the Smart City Research Group from the Institute of 
Mathematics and Statistics - University of SÃ£o Paulo.

The main purpose of this project is to provide high-level services and APIs 
to support the development of novel services for cities by gathering 
key-enabling technologies such as IoT, Big Data and
Cloud Computer. The platform adopts a microservice architecture which is 
designed to properly support the integration of a large amount of device
and data, and provide quality city-scale services. 

Among others, the platform provides the following features:

* City's resource discovery
* Hide technical details of communication with physical devices
* Provide real-time data from city sensors
* Provide historical data from city sensors
* Data filtering through different parameters
* Intermediate communication with actuators
